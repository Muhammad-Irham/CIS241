		This was a fun personally project. I really enjoyed figuring out how to make the nav bar "interactive" with the help of guides and tutorials available on the web.<br>I wished this course had covered more of the animations and transition affects available on CSS. I really noticed myself spending way too much time on the navigation bar.<br>If I had more time to work on this project, I would have figured out a way to make everything (within reason and aesthetics) interactable. <br> I found myself really struggling with writing content for this site, if I had the choice I would have put place holder texts and really focused on the design and experience of this site. 
		<br>
		<br>
	Going on into the future, I think I will spend more time working on this site. Eventually I will make this into a portfolio <br>to showcase my creative skills and past projects from 	my graphic design class

		<h3>Thank you for reading my thoughts! I hope you enjoyed navigating my site (and most importantly fidgeting with the navigation bar).</h3>
