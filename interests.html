	<p>Ever since covid-19 struck, I've been bored at home and have found myself looking for things to do. I happened to walk past the fish aisle during a routine trip to petsmart for cat supplies, and decided to pick up a Betta fish out of curiousity. After buying the betta fish randomly, I researched more and more about the hobby and bought plants for the aquarium once in a while. If you are in the Seattle area, I highly suggest visiting <a href="https://www.aquariumcoop.com/" target="_blank">Aquarium Coop</a>, they have a large selection of fresh water fish, and their website contains helpful tips on how to start or care for an aquarium.

	<p>LoL is a multiplayer online battle areana game that tasks players against each other. Players are put in a team of five and need to work together to destroy the enemy base. Players are able to pick a hero with a special set of abilities and need to use their full potential to defeat their opponents. You can download the game and create an account <a href="https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/" target="_blank">here</a></p>

	<p>Currently, I like to listen to korean R&B. My favorite playlist on spotify is the "TrenChill K-R&B" playlist. This is what I normally listen to while doing homework assignments or playing LoL.
